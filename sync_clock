For example, open /etc/ntp.conf file using vi text editor:
# vi /etc/ntp.conf

Locate server parameter and set it as follows:
server pool.ntp.org

Save the file and restart the ntpd service:
# /etc/init.d/ntpd start

You can synchronize the system clock to an NTP server immediately with following command:
# ntpdate pool.ntp.org
